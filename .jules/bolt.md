## 2026-03-20 - Batching RPC calls in functional tests
**Learning:** Functional tests that make sequential `getblock` or `getblockhash` RPC calls inside loops or comprehensions suffer from N+1 query bottlenecks, leading to slow execution times.
**Action:** Use `node.batch([node.getblock.get_request(b) for b in blocks])` to batch RPC requests instead of iterating and calling them sequentially.
